# Workflow description on YouTube:

1. [Training dense networks with the C++ EigenNET project](https://youtu.be/URUI8-ogtNk), shows a classification model based on the MNIST dataset.
2. [Regression model with the EigenNET project Dense NN](https://youtu.be/SUaSmL_UbrA), shows a regression model based on the AMES dataset (similar to the Boston House dataset).
3. [Visualization of a Dense NN Network](https://youtu.be/_YW4ukvN2dg), This video describes how network training with the C++ program Dense_NN can be analyzed graphically in an R workflow using a network representation. This representation shows the relationship between the neurons and their connection strength.
