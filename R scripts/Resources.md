# Workflow description on YouTube:

1. [Training dense networks with the C++ EigenNET project](https://youtu.be/URUI8-ogtNk), shows a classification model based on the MNIST dataset.
2. [Regression model with the EigenNET project Dense NN](https://youtu.be/SUaSmL_UbrA), shows a regression model based on the AMES dataset (similar to the Boston House dataset).
3. [Visualization of a Dense NN Network](https://youtu.be/_YW4ukvN2dg), This video describes how network training with the C++ program Dense_NN can be analyzed graphically in an R workflow using a network representation. This representation shows the relationship between the neurons and their connection strength.
4. [Iterative Training of a Deep Learning Structure with Dense NN](https://youtu.be/IxJUkCk8yvA), This video describes the ***iterative*** training of a deep learning structure in an R workflow using the lean and highly efficient Dense_NN program. This means that when new training data becomes available, the already trained network can be further trained with the new data.
5. [Dense NN and use of the RMSProp and Adam optimizers](https://youtu.be/lVIkmxNejVM), This video uses an R workflow as an example to describe how the new ***RMSProp*** and ***Adam*** (V0.1.20) **optimizers** are used to train a deep learning structure.
6. [Dense_NN, CIFAR-10 and SVD](https://youtu.be/LYoJIlt-STs), This video demonstrates the effect of dimensionality reduction using SVD (singular value decomposition) using the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example. 
7. [Deep Learning Structures with Dense_NN on a Raspberry Pi5](https://youtu.be/_UKoZ-AY2UM), This video describes how ***Dense_NN can be used on a Linux system***. To do this, Dense_NN is installed on a Raspberry Pi5 and the training of a deep learning structure is again demonstrated using the MNIST data set as an example.

8. [Parallel Dense Network Training with Dens_NN](https://youtu.be/uR33e8AVX2w), This video demonstrates the ***parallel training of a dense network***. It also shows how to use it on a Raspberry Pi5. The effect of managing parallel processes by overloading the Pi5 becomes apparent. This is due to the resources of the Pi5 and not to Dense_NN.
