# Dense_NN
## Dense_NN is an EigenNET project for training dense-type neural networks implemented in C++.

### Features:
<ul>
<li>Dense network architecture with adjustable depth and activation functions</li>
<li>Eigen-based matrix operations for maximum speed</li>
<li>Minimal code footprint, maximum control</li>
<li>Ideal for demonstrations, teaching, and research</li>
</ul>
